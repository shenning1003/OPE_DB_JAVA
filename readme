Overview
        This program is a working prototype that tries to protect the query completeness. It uses OPE to encrypt the data and insert fake tuples
into the database. In this new scheme, the client is able to directly re-generate the fake tuples. Thus, validating the query completeness becomes 
easier.

How to Run
        First, compile the OPE implementation from CrypteDB.
